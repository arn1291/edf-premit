 			created in Ubuntu 12.04 with python 2.7

RUNNING:
1. RUN THE edf.py file
2. give inputs such as: process name
			computation time
			deadline
3.give submit
4.give various deadlines to check the preemit
5.Once you give inputs you can see them running on the terminal.and context switiching if needed
6.now you can get outputs

OUTPUTS:
1)RUNTIME:
just open the output.html file in the current directory which will give the running process graph

2)GANTT CHART:
click the "Give output button in the window to reaveal the gantt chart for each second

3)PRESENTATION:
click generate output to get the processor usage , average waiting time, average turn around time graphs.

then open the index.html inside the impress.js-master directory.

edit the presentation as needed.(ready with your edf-preemitive)

NOTE:
*the execution function is considered as the processor, the timer variable is calculated as the clock,

*a module to determine your own clock time is also given but i have not used the function if you want you can just disable the comment, so that you can slow down the total process.
